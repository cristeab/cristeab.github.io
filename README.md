I am an experienced software engineer in cross-platform application development. My main interests lie at the intersection between software development and networking. 
I am developer/maintainer for several open-source projects:

* [BCPhone](https://github.com/cristeab/bcphone) - a cloud based softphone

* [P2PCommPlatf](https://github.com/cristeab/p2p_comm_platf) - a peer to peer communication platform

* [FiscalRecords](https://github.com/cristeab/EvidentaFiscala) - an application for keeping fiscal records in CSV files

* [TabletReader](https://github.com/cristeab/tabletReader) - a tablet reader using Okular backend. Selected for Intel's Ultrabook Experience Software Contest.

* [IT++ library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/itpp) - a C++ library with signal processing algorithms

* [Free Student Management System](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freesms)

As Ph student, my research interests were related to digital signal processing and their application to multiple access systems. Samples of my work as researcher can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/cristeab/).
