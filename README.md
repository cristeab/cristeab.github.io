# Introduction

I am an experienced software engineer in cross-platform application development. My main interests lie at the intersection between software development and networking. 
I am developer/maintainer for [several open-source projects](open_source_projects).

As Ph student, my research interests were related to digital signal processing and their application to multiple access systems. Samples of my work as researcher can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/cristeab/).
